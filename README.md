# STED_Noise_Estimation
This is a python script for estimation of Poisson noise and generating a noisy data set from a high SNR data set. This is usefule for training a supervised deep learning
network to denoise fast confocal/STED microscopy data since the dominant source of noise in those cases is Poisson.
